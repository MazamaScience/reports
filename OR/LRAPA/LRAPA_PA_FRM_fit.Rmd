# Background 
 - discussion of PA vs FRM monitors and how lm() can be used to "correct" PA pm25 so that it more closely matches FRM pm25.

# LRAPA 
 - discussion what LRAPA is, how they have co-located sensor-monitor pairs.
 Amazon Park -- a few plots showing that this sensor is basically good and matches the FRM data quite well
 
# Linear fit 
- Using lm(pm25_monitor ~ pm25 + humidity) and a 5-day window to created our model. Then use predict() to create corrected (aka "fitted") values. Code snippet to show what we are doing. For a one-week window in July, show FRM pm25, PA pm25 and corrected (PA values with the lm() calculated linear correction applied.)

# EPA correction 
- show a 4-month plot with PA pm25, FRM pm25 and EPA "corrected" pm25 (PA values with EPA linear correction applied.); This plot should show that the EPA "over corrects" during the smoky period.
 Real-time linear fit -- Show the fit parameters for EPA (straight lines) and for real-time lm(). Pick ylim() that highlights the pm25 and humidity values. Don't worry about the smoky period when the intercept goes crazy.

# Real-time vs EPA 
_ Discussion and plots showing PA pm25, FRM pm25, EPA corrected pm25 and real-time corrected pm25 for one week in July and one smoky week in October
