# California Assembly Bill 617

_Last updated January 31, 2021_

----

## Background

(http://www.airquality.org/air-quality-health/community-air-protection/ab-617-background)

> In 2017, Governor Brown signed [Assembly Bill 617 (C. Garcia, Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB617) to develop a new community focused program to more effectively reduce exposure to air pollution and preserve public health. This bill directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and all local air districts, including the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (Sac Metro Air District or District), to take measures to protect communities disproportionally impacted by air pollution. With input from communities and air districts throughout California, [CARB developed a Community Air Protection Blueprint to implement AB 617](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/community-air-protection-program/community-air-protection-blueprint).
>
> There are five central components to the new AB 617 mandate:
> 
> * Community-level air monitoring
> * A state strategy and community specific emission reduction plans
> * Accelerated review of retrofit pollution control technologies on industrial facilities subject to Cap-and-Trade
> * Enhanced emission reporting requirements
> * Increased penalty provisions for polluters
> 
> Additionally, CARB may direct additional grant funding to communities determined to have the highest air pollution burden.

## Summarise the goals of the "community-level air monitoring" component.

_INPROGRESS_

The overarching goal of the “community-level air monitoring” is to identify the communities with the highest air pollution burden, with a focus on criteria air pollutants and toxic air contaminants, to develop *new community-specific emissions reduction programs*. 

## How much money is being spent (annualy?) and where does it come from?

_INPROGRESS_
> To jump-start emissions reductions in disproportionately burdened communities, the fiscal year 2017-2018 State budget included $250 million to help clean up heavily polluting mobile sources, like diesel trucks and buses. Further, the fiscal year 2018-2019 State budget includes an additional $245 million in funding for continuing AB 617 emissions reduction effort ([Community Air Protection Blueprint](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/final_community_air_protection_blueprint_october_2018_acc.pdf)).

>	Since 2017 the California Legislature has [budgeted $704 million]( https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/community-air-protection-incentives/about) to support Assembly Bill (AB) 617 (C. Garcia, Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017) with incentives directed by local air districts to put advanced technologies to work for cleaner air in the California communities that are most heavily impacted by disproportionate levels of air pollution.

> The Legislature has appropriated money from the Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Fund (GGRF) for incentives to support AB 617, as summarized in Table 1 in
the Appendix of the [Biannual Report on AB 617 Community Air Protection Incentives](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/cap_incentives_april_2020_board_update.pdf). 

According to this report, the deadline of the 2020-2021 budget of $200 million proposed by the Governor is yet to be defined. 

## Which state agencies are in charge?

_TODO_

_Jon Comment: I think this is all CARB and its regional AQMDs and APCDs. A brief
summary of CARB and their mission would be appropriate here._

## What progress has been made to date?

_INPROGRESS_
Since 2018, more than 120 communities have been nominated for consideration for community actions defined as monitoring and/or emission reduction programs, but only 13 have been approved. 
The [CARB website](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/capp-selection) does not include a clear plan for 2021. They mention that "one of the main lessons learned is that building new community partnerships and developing and implementing effective community-focused programs takes time and resources" and that the 2020-2021 state budget is very limited. This affected the number of communities considered for addition to the Program in 2020 and it will limit new 2021 additions. 

## Which of the Air Quality Managment Districts (AQMDs) have made the most progress?

_TODO_

## What other organizations (federal agencies universities, NGOs, ...) have been working with community data.

_INPROGRESS_
The Community Air Protection Program includes a [multi-stakeholder Consultation Group]( https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/community-air-protection-program-ab617/community-air-protection-program-consultation-group), whose members work for environmental justice organizations, air districts, industry, academia, public health organizations, and local government.

## To what extent is community monitoring data open access?

_INPROGRESS_
**needs review and further reasearch. To be continued next week**

At a higher level (parts of State, air basins, counties) air quality data is easily accessible through the [Air Quality Data (PST) Query Tool](https://www.arb.ca.gov/aqmis2/aqdselect.php), which generates csv reports on [criteria](https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants), toxic, and GHG pollutant emissions, including PM2.5 (ppm/ppb).

At the community level, data is temporally and geographically limited. Only 7 out of the 13 communities currently under monitoring provide reports, and the most recent reports are from May 2020 or earlier depending on the community. 

Following is a list of the communities providing [downloadable data](https://aqview.arb.ca.gov/data.html):
* East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, West Commerce
* San Bernardino, Muscoy
* Portside Environmental Justice Neighborhoods
* Shafter
* South Central Fresno
* South Sacramento - Florin
* Wilmington, Carson, West Long Beach

Reports include: Community Name, Data Provider, Site Name, Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Monitor ID, Parameter Code, Parameter Name, Measurement Start Time, Measured Value, Adjusted Value, Units, Adjustment Description, and Instrument. Some also include Measurement Technique Description and Code. The columns name in the reports could slightly vary depending on the community. For instance, South Sacramento – Florin has the column “Measurement Start Time” while San Bernardino, Muscoy has the column “StartDateTime”. Description of each column and details on the downloadable data can be found in the [Data Download Explainer](https://aqview.arb.ca.gov/Resources/Data-Download-Explainer.pdf). 

Criteria and toxic pollutant emissions data are stored in the California Emissions Inventory Development and Reporting System ([CEIDARS]( https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/ei/drei/maintain/dbstruct.htm)), which serves as the main repository for emissions data used to develop air quality management plans to show attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality standards. GHG emissions data are stored in CARB’s Mandatory Reporting Regulation ([MRR]( https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/mandatory-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reporting)) database. MMR's Facility IDs are different from CEIDARS's database IDs.

Moreover, CARB has released a [Pollution Mapping Tool]( https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/ei/tools/pollution_map/pollution_map.htm), which allows users to explore maps but also to visualize graphs and export data on emissions from large facilities (stationary point sources). However, the most recent year available is 2018, and there are [caveats about using data in the tool for Comparative analyses](https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/ei/tools/pollution_map/doc/caveats%20document10_19_2020.pdf) since the criteria, toxic and GHG pollutant emissions data presented in the tool are collected through different emissions reporting programs, each designed to meet specific goals. The tool is slow and not very user friendly.

## What types of sensors/monitors are being used to generate data? 
(to be continued tomorrow)
A summary of monitoring technologies employed by communities and the science behind them can be found [here](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/capp-resource-center/community-air-monitoring/outline-of-measurement-technologies). 

Following, a closer look to the monitoring methods and equipment employed by each community:

* [Richmond-San Pablo community]( https://www.baaqmd.gov/community-health/community-health-protection-program/richmond-area-community-health-protection-program): [Monitoring Methods and Equipment (p. 46, C-4)](https://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/files/ab617-community-health/richmond/richmondsanpabloairmonitoringplanjuly2020-pdf.pdf?la=en): Custom-designed Aclima mobile sensor nodes, measuring measure carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide
(CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter (PM2.5). 

* [West Oakland](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/community-air-protection-program/communities/west-oakland). No methods/technologies/sensors found. It is possible that they get their data from [Bay Area Air Quality Management District]( https://www.baaqmd.gov/) which seems to use low-cost sensors such as PM sensors to count particles, PurpleAir, and Clarity. This info was found in the [Air Quality Data Sources Explained]( https://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/files/communications-and-outreach/wildfire-materials/air-quality-data-sources-explained-pdf.pdf?la=en), and there is no reference to AB 617. The [West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project]( https://woeip.org/) partnered with the Air District and a community-based Steering Committee to develop [Owning Our Air: The West Oakland Community Action Plan](https://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/files/ab617-community-health/west-oakland/2020_1101_wo_annual_report_slide_deck-pdf.pdf?la=en) which includes [6 Air District and 8 CARB measures].

_TODO_

## What types of analysis have been done on this data?

_TODO_

_Jon Comment: The AQview data viewer is what CARB thinks is important. You might
look at other viewers or reports and just summarize the different types of graphics
or analyses they are using to communicate information._ Is it current only? Archival?
Time series analysis? Maps?

## What software tools are being used to analyze this data?

_TODO_

_Jon Comment: This may be hard to figure out unless pages specifically mention
software. But it might be interesting to look at the different types of data downlaod
they provide._

## _Other interesting questions that come up_
