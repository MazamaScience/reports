## Background

This document is a companion document for `CA_AB_617.md` and demonstrates how
Mazama Science R packages can be used to work with "community-level air monitoring data".

## _TODO:_

This document is currently a placeholder for analysis and visualization examples
working with data relevant to AB 617 communities.
